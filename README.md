## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes a **Sales Dataset (1,000 transactions)** using **Excel**. It covers data cleaning, pivot analysis, and dashboard design, highlighting key KPIs such as $2.59M total sales, 73.8% profit margin, and top-performing products/markets. The project demonstrates Excel’s power in turning raw data into actionable business intelligence..  

## 🗂️ Dataset  
- **Records:** 1,000  
- **Columns (Raw):** 15 → expanded to 22 in Cleaned Data  
- **Unique Key:** Order ID  
- **Date Range:** Jan 2023 – Dec 2024  

## 🔧 Process  
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates (0 found, but checked by `Order ID`)  
   - Handled missing values (dropped empty columns `Unnamed: 0` and `Unnamed: 1`)  
   - Standardized product names, added segmentation fields (`Age Bracket`, `Months`, `Yearly Quarter`, `Full Name`).  

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Sales trends by Month & Quarter  
   - Top products, regions, and customers  
   - Customer demographics (Age, Gender)  
   - Correlation analysis (Sales ↔ Profit, Price, Quantity, Age)  

3. **Pivot Tables**
   - Sales by Product, Country, Region  
   - Customer contribution analysis  
   - Seasonality analysis  

4. **Dashboard**
   - KPI cards (Total Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, Avg. Order Value)  
   - Product & Region performance visuals  
   - Customer leaderboard  
   - Time-series (Monthly & Quarterly Sales)
